# Random-Webpages
A collection of different webpages designed by me. I use these webpages to learn HTML, CSS and eventually JS. 
These will mostly be based on https://www.freecodecamp.org and https://www.theodinproject.com .

A web preview of my projects can be seen at https://trmen.github.io/Random-Webpages/
